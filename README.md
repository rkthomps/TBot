# Investigation of Algorithmic Trading with Machine Learning

## Abstract
Performing inference in the stock market is a natural application of machine learning methods because of the accesibility of market data, and the possibility of monetary gain. Despite copius market data, accurate prediction of stock prices has proven to be a challenging problem for researchers. The purpose of this project is to investigate the profitability of various algorithmic trading strategies. As part of this investigation, we predict stock prices on both weekly and monthly timeframes using multiple machine learning methods. These methods perform inference over technical and fundimental market indicators.
